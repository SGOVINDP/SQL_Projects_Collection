# SQL Project: Music Store Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the music store's operations by answering specific questions using SQL queries. The database contains information about employees, customers, invoices, tracks, and more. By querying this data, we can uncover valuable information about the store's performance and customer preferences.

## Question Set 1 - Easy
Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
Which countries have the most invoices?
What are the top 3 values of total invoices?
Which city has the best customers?
We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city where we made the most money. Write a query that returns the city with the highest sum of invoice totals, including the city name and the sum of all invoice totals.
Who is the best customer?
The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money.

## Question Set 2 - Moderate
Email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners:
Write a query to return the email, first name, last name, and genre of all Rock music listeners. Return the list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.
Top 10 Rock Music Artists:
Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.
Tracks longer than average song length:
Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. Return the name and milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length, with the longest songs listed first.

## Question Set 3 - Advance
Amount spent by each customer on artists:
Write a query to return customer name, artist name, and total amount spent by each customer on different artists.

Top customer in each country:
Write a query that determines the customer who has spent the most on music for each country. Return the country along with the top customer and the amount they spent. For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers with the top amount.
