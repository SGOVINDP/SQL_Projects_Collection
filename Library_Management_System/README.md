**Library Management System**<br>
The project will involve creating a database schema for a library management system 
that tracks books, authors, publishers, borrowers, and loans. It will also involve writing 
PL/SQL code to create tables, insert sample data, write queries, and create views, 
functions, triggers, and procedures.
