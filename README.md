# SQL_Projects_Collection
## Overview
The "SQL Projects Collection" repository includes various SQL tasks and projects. This repository demonstrates the practical application of SQL to address real-world scenarios, including data manipulation, querying, and stored procedure implementation. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in SQL and my capacity to analyze complex data. They exhibit my abilities in data investigation, visualization, and analysis.

## Usage
- Install a SQL database such as SQL Server Express
- Import any .sql files to run the queries
- Modify the queries for your own database

## Projects
### Employee Department Analysis
This case study demonstrates various SQL operations including database creation, table creation, data insertion, updates, arithmetic operations, logical operations, comparison operations, date functions, math functions, string functions, merge operations, grouping, indexing, views, transactions, stored procedures, triggers, and functions.<br>

It Contains Two Tables: Employees and Departments which are Connected by a Foraign Key "DepartmentID".<br>

<br><br>

### Library Management System
The project will involve creating a database schema for a library management system that tracks books, authors, publishers, borrowers, and loans. It will also involve writing PL/SQL code to create tables, insert sample data, write queries, and create views, functions, triggers, and procedures.

### Shopping Cart
This project involves creating a database schema for a shopping cart system. It includes tables for users, products, carts, orders, and their respective items. The script also includes sample data insertion, constraints, and various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

### Analyzing Employee Trends:<br> 
This project involved performing extensive analysis on employee data to uncover insights and trends. The data contained information on employees across departments, including demographics, job roles, satisfaction, attrition and more.<br>

I utilized SQL to explore the data and answer key business questions to derive actionable insights.<br><br>

**Tasks Performed**<br>
- Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the HR dataset
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze employee counts, averages, distributions across various dimensions like department, age, education etc.
- Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels by department to understand departmental trends
- Calculated employee attrition rates by age band to pinpoint high risk groups
- Analyzed factors related to attrition like age, education, job satisfaction to uncover drivers
- Compared averages and aggregates across different employee segments and criteria
- Identified top and bottom performers on key metrics like satisfaction, attrition based on criteria
- Used SQL techniques like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE statements for complex analysis
- Organized and presented findings in a clear format for consumption by leadership

## About SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for interacting with relational databases. Key SQL capabilities:

- CRUD operations - create, read, update, delete data
- Joins - combine data from multiple tables
- Aggregate functions - summations, counts, averages on data
- Subqueries - nested queries for advanced operations
- Stored procedures - reusable routines for logic
- Window functions - analytics functions for rankings etc.
For these examples, I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
